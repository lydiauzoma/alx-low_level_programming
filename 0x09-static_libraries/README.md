0x09. C - Static libraries
In the C programming language, a static library is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate (functions, variables etc.) as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.

tatic libraries arenâ€™t loaded by the compiler at run-time; only the executable file need be loaded. Static library object files instead are loaded near the end of compilation during its linking phase.
