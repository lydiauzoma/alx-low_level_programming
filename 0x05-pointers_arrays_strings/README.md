 - Pointers, arrays and strings

The pointer in C language is a variable which stores the address of another variable. This variable can be of type int, char, array, function, or any other pointer. The size of the pointer depends on the architecture. However, in 32-bit architecture the size of a pointer is 2 byte.

Array in C can be defined as a method of clubbing multiple entities of similar type into a larger group. These entities or elements can be of int, float, char, or double data type or can be of user-defined data types too like structures.

Strings are used for storing text/characters.
For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters.
Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. However, you can use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:
