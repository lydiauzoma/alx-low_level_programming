 - More functions, more nested loops
Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as “loop inside loop“

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
