# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

## Description
I've recently began my software engineering career at ALX, and as part of requirement, we started learning low level programming language starting with C programming language. Over the next few months i would be applying the knowledge learnt to solving basic tasks. This repository could serve as a guide to aspiring Software engineer at entry level.
